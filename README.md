Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project focuses on segmenting customers using unsupervised machine learning techniques to better understand purchasing behavior and customer value.

Dataset:
Marketing campaign data containing customer demographics, income, spending across product categories, and purchase behavior.

Project Workflow:

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering (Age, TotalSpent, Children, Customer Tenure)

Feature scaling using RobustScaler

Optimal cluster selection using Elbow Method

Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering

Cluster profiling and business interpretation

Outcome:
The model segmented customers into four distinct groups, each representing unique spending and engagement patterns. These insights can help businesses design targeted marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and customer retention strategies.

Tech Stack:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
